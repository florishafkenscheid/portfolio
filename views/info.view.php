            Hey there! I'm Floris Hafkenscheid, a passionate Software Development student at Windesheim. My journey in coding started way back in middle school, and I haven't stopped since. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Currently based in Dronten, Flevoland, I'm working towards becoming a specialist in both data science and artificial intelligence. My ultimate goal? Completing master's degrees in both fields to really push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.
            <br>
            <br>
            When I'm not diving into code or exploring the latest tech innovations, you'll find me on the volleyball court or perfecting my swing on the golf course. And speaking of sports, I'm also a big motorsport enthusiast â€“ currently riding an Aprilia RS 50 and dreaming about upgrading to a proper superbike someday.
            <br>
            <br>
            Looking for a driven software developer who brings both technical skills and creative thinking to the table? Let's connect and create something amazing together.
